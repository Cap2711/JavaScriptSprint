# JavaScriptSprint
Midterm sprint for JS for Naomi moores and Chelsey penton
This is a command-line tool we made using JavaScript. It helps set up folders for a web app, manages how the app is set up, and creates special codes (tokens) for users to confirm their accounts. You can also add, update, or find info about users with it. There's also a simple web page where users can get their confirmation code by entering their username.
